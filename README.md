# Azure ARM & Bicep Deployment Lab – Personal Documentation

This repository is my personal record of hands-on labs focused on automating Azure resource deployment using ARM templates, Bicep, Cloud Shell, PowerShell, and the Azure CLI. The included screenshots and markdown files document what I learned, the steps I practiced, and my observations.

## What I Did

- Practiced exporting and editing ARM templates from existing Azure resources.
- Iterated on template deployments by changing parameters and resource configuration.
- Used PowerShell and Azure CLI in Cloud Shell to automate deployments from uploaded templates.
- Explored and verified deployments using both JSON ARM templates and Bicep for a managed disk.
- Captured every step with screenshots for full traceability and review.

## Repo Structure

- **docs/** – My markdown documentation for each task
  - `create azure resource manager template.md`
  - `edit and redeploy template.md`
  - `deploy template with powershell.md`
  - `deploy template with CLI.md`
  - `deploy with bicep.md`
- **screenshots/** – Folders organized by lab, containing all my screenshots as evidence of completion and reference.

## Key Learnings

- I can consistently export, edit, and redeploy Azure resources via templated automation.
- Using Cloud Shell and both PowerShell & Bash gives me flexibility for infrastructure as code (IaC).
- Bicep files are easier to read and edit than pure ARM JSON, but produce the same end result.
- Capturing detailed screenshots helped reinforce my step sequences and gave me a visual log of my Azure journey.

## Why I Did This

- To gain deep, hands-on confidence with Azure infrastructure automation.
- To have step-by-step evidence of my knowledge and ability for future reference or certifications.
- To create a reusable template for future labs, testing, or prepping for real-world Azure deployments.
